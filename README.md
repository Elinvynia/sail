# Sail

This is a cute and simple 2D game I am making for my girlfriend. You are a sailor, trading cargo with outposts and avoiding pirates. It's very Work In Progress, but I'm getting there.

## Dependencies

You need the SDL2.0 development libraries installed, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).

To statically link SDL2, you can use the `static` feature of this project.
